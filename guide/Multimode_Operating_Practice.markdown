Pausing between transmissions is "key" to reliable multimode digital voice communications on the KR4CHS repeater.[^1]  

QSOs that adhere to the following practice will make QSOs better for all operators and enhance communication.

<ol style="color:#FF0000" type="1">
<li>After the transmitting Operator completes a transmission,
<strong>pause 3 seconds</strong>.</li>
<li>After the 3 second pause, PTT and continue pressing PTT for
<strong>3 seconds before talking</strong>. This allows the other digital
modes and the transcoder to "engage."</li>
<li>Talk.</li>
<li>Say "over" or "back to you," and if 3 or more operators in the QSO,
the callsign to which you are passing the QSO in order to mitigate
doubling.</li>
<li>Stop talking but continue pressing the PTT for <strong>2 more
seconds</strong> to allow your transmission and the transcoding process
to complete on the other digital modes.</li>
<li>Release PTT.</li>
</ol>

Here are some other helpful operating practices.

- Be aware of what your display is telling you.  If an operator tries to break in a name or call might be seen momentarily on your display even if no voice is heard.

- Be patient and work together to pass the QSO to next speaker to avoid doubling.

- If possible place hotspots at home QTH on a RJ45 connection.

- Use the Calibrate option in the hotspot software to set offset the best you can get it.

- Be particularly aware of keeping the PTT engaged during your transmission. 

- D-STAR operators direct to repeater or on a hotspot must be on the Gateway. Contact us if you need assistance.

- If there is a dropout mid sentence during a transmission, wait because it will probably come back if given a few seceonds.

[^1]: Quick keying will not get good results when on a Reflector or Repeater connected to a Reflector especially one that performs transcoding (KR4CHS on XRF517A) and in addition quick keying will make it difficult for others to break in and participate.
